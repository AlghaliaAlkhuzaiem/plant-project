                          Pothos plants are arguably one of the easiest plants to grow and actually thrive on low light and neglect. These plants serve to purify the air of formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide while also helping eliminate odors

Pothos can thrive in standard houseplant potting mix or a chunky, well-draining aroid mix. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings</p>

                            <p>Nearly everywhere throughout the world, people associate the peace lily with tranquility and serenity. The peace lily plant has adopted this meaning for itself since white is frequently seen as a symbol of peace. Its white flower is reminiscent of the white flags flowing all over the world as a sign of truth.
                              <h4>Taking Care Of It</h4>
                              Water your peace lily regularly, ideally so the compost never completely dried out but is also not waterlogged. As a general rule, wait until the top few centimetres of compost have dried out before watering again. If you don't water them often enough you'll soon be able to tell â€“ peace lilies wilt when dehydrated.
